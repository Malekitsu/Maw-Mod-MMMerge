14	item014	Knightly Broadsword	600	Weapon	Sword	3d4	9	8	11	Broadsword	3	0	0	12	131	The weight of this sword's untapered blade would make it unwieldy if not for its exacting counterbalance.

24	item024	Master's Dagger	225	Weapon	Dagger	1d2	6	6	10	Dagger	5	0	0	19	80	"Daggers of this quality are rare indeed. Made of erudine and rare woods, finished in gold, and set with a sizable ruby, this would be a rich man's extravagance if it were not also so effective a weapon."
25	item025	Fanged Blade	350	Weapon	Dagger	2d2	8	6	15	Dagger	5	0	0	20	45	The grip on this blade has clearly been rewrapped many times. It is said that such blades were used by the first Vampires who appeared millennia before the Silence. Could this possibly be one of those ancient weapons?

35	item035	Minotaur Battleaxe	650	Weapon	Axe	4d2	11	5	13	Axe	7	0	0	41	110	"Forged by the Minotaurs for their wars with the Ogres, these axes are forged of a secret alloy formula. Their edges are difficult to dull and even harder to sharpen."
36	item036	Two-Handed Axe	150	Weapon2	Axe	3d6	0	6	1	Two-Handed Axe	8	0	0	40	92	"As much an implement for working wood as a weapon, this crude axe can still deliver a telling blow."

44	item044	War Spear	500	Weapon1or2	Spear	1d8	12	6	12	Spear	9	0	0	25	124	"This spear is built for battle. Far to heavy to be wielded by the part-time militiaman, it is built for the professional warrior who prefers the spear to other weapons."

46	item046	Improvised Voulge	100	Weapon1or2	Spear	3d5	0	6	1	Halberd	10	0	0	34	93	This simple poleaxe appears to have been made by attaching the blade of a farm implement to a poorly crafted spear.
47	item048	Halberd	400	Weapon1or2	Spear	3d6	3	6	5	Halberd	10	0	0	30	111	"A versatile weapon combining the qualities of an axe and a spear, the halberd is designed to perform in formation and individual close quarter fighting."
48	item047	Beaked Halberd	700	Weapon1or2	Spear	3d5	10	6	9	Halberd	10	0	0	38	107	This improved halberd has a spiked blade opposite its axe face to provide both balance and a means of penetrating plate armor.

50	item050	Labyrinth Grapple	1600	Weapon1or2	Spear	3d6	16	6	15	Halberd	10	0	0	24	135	Minotaurs have very little tolerance for intruders in their hallowed mazes. This fact is well evidenced in the attention paid to weapons constructed for the labyrinth guards.
51	item051	Hayfork	100	Weapon1or2	Spear	2d6	0	6	2	Trident	11	0	0	25	113	"Though a common farming implement, this hayfork is of sturdy construction and could be an excellent, if improvised, weapon."

The second is a sense that the dragon turtle bone tines seem to seek vulnerabilities in their targets' defenses as if guided by an unseen hand.
56	item056	Hunting Bow	150	Missile	Bow	5d2	0	6	2	Bow	12	0	0	23	96	These lightweight bows of simple construction are meant for bringing down small game animals - not for direct combat.

58	item058	Snakewood Bow	400	Missile	Bow	4d2	7	3	8	Bow	12	0	0	24	100	"The human soldiers of Enroth carry bows made from the native snakewood tree. The strong, flexible wood makes a sturdy bow."
59	item059	Elven Warbow	600	Missile	Bow	5d2	10	3	12	Bow	12	0	0	23	102	"By laminating together layers of wood, steel, and bone the bowsmiths of Alvar have created a bow of perfect balance, strength and accuracy. The process consumes a lot of time, craft and expensive materials which explains the steep price these bows command."
60	item060	Devilbone Bow	750	Missile	Bow	5d2	12	3	13	Bow	12	0	0	30	100	Dark Elven bowsmiths have discovered that unusual characteristics of the Kreegan spinal column make it the best material for heavy bowstaves. A clever arrangement of composite pulleys make it possible for those of less than superhuman strength to pull these mighty weapons.
61	item061	Light Crossbow	100	Missile	Bow	3d2	2	4	4	Crossbow	13	0	0	28	70	"Because of their ease of use, crossbows like these are stockpiled in militia armories everywhere. Their low pull strength and mediocre workmanship however, make them only moderately effective."
62	item062	Blood Drop Crossbow	225	Missile	Bow	3d2	5	4	8	Crossbow	13	0	0	26	75	"A light crossbow of good quality, these weapons feature a grooved table, basic sights and a smooth releasing nut."

65	item065	Regnan Crossbow	750	Missile	Bow	4d2	11	4	15	Crossbow	13	0	0	37	92	The pirates of Regna Island have spent centuries perfecting their crossbow design. The resulting weapon has a crystal lensed sight and bowstaves of pure stalt - which would make the bow impossible to cock if not for the crank draw of erudine alloy.
66	item066	Sturdy Mace	75	Weapon	Mace	2d4	1	6	3	Mace	14	0	0	22	116	"A slight improvement over the common club, maces are better balanced, more durable, and deliver greater damage."
67	item067	Flail	250	Weapon	Mace	2d4	4	6	6	Flail	14	0	0	58	113	"Though evolved from the farm implement which shares its name, the flail's great reach and striking power make it a fearsome weapon."
68	item068	Temple Mace	400	Weapon	Mace	2d4	7	6	9	Mace	14	0	0	33	126	The sunray corona circling the head of this well made mace serves as a devotional declaration for Temple of the Sun clerics; it also greatly increases the damage of its blows. 
69	item069	Reverend Sceptre	550	Weapon	Mace	2d3	11	6	12	Mace	14	0	0	12	159	"As much a symbol of office as weapon, these finely crafted maces are carried by inner circle Sun Temple priests. Its highly decorated shaft belies the effectiveness of the gilded erudine-steel head."
70	item070	Trollish War Mace	700	Weapon	Mace	2d3	13	6	14	Mace	14	0	0	30	177	"While most races have concentrated on developing bladed weapons, the Trolls have always been content to refine the simple bludgeon. This brutal weapon forged as a single piece of stalt alloy is the finest example of their craft."
71	item071	Sledgehammer	150	Weapon	Mace	2d4	2	6	4	Hammer	15	0	0	26	76	"This hammer is more a construction tool than a weapon. Still, it could deliver a telling, if clumsy, blow."
72	item072	Field Hammer	350	Weapon	Mace	2d4	5	6	8	Hammer	15	0	0	21	107	This hammer was designed as secondary infantry arm designed to finish off armored opponents who have fallen to the ground.
73	item073	Warhammer	450	Weapon	Mace	2d5	6	6	9	Hammer	15	0	0	26	103	"An improved version of the field hammer, this weapon is heavier, better balanced and more durable. While it requires strength to wield, it is a terrible sight to armored and unarmored foes alike."
74	item074	Sun Hammer	650	Weapon	Mace	2d4	11	6	12	Hammer	15	0	0	19	107	"Clerics of the Sun are prohibited from using bladed weapons. That they carry such fine warhammers is the natural result of this restriction. As an added measure of devotion, a reverse image of their sun symbol is embossed on the striking face."
75	item075	Trollish Maul	850	Weapon	Mace	2d5	14	6	15	Hammer	15	0	0	31	107	It is necessary to handle this weapon to appreciate its perfect grip and balance. The hammer's head is carved from a single mineral crystal. Trollish weaponsmiths spend a lifetime mastering the shaping technique to produce a head that retains incredible hardness without being shatter prone.
76	item076	Barbed Club	10	Weapon	Club	1d2	1	3	2	Club	16	0	0	16	119	"A wooden head and handle studded with short iron spikes, the simple club's best attribute is that it can be constructed from found materials."
77	item077	Thornbark Club	40	Weapon	Club	1d3	3	3	5	Club	16	0	0	31	148	The Trolls of the Ironsand Desert make these clubs by fire-hardening the fantastically tough root wood of the thornbark tree.
78	item078	Overlord's Club	350	Weapon	Mace	3d3	6	3	8	Club	16	0	0	26	161	Troll tribal chieftains must win their position through trial by combat. The winner keeps his club as a symbol of office. The losers' clubs often find their way into the weapon marketplace.
