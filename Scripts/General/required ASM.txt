Following list will be orderer by importance:
1) something to modify both generateitem and itemgenerated functions
2) attribute breakpoints
3) tooltip hook
4) hook to modify HP 
5) hook on right click in stat menu (might, endurance etc)

If point 1 is not doable I will probably need to do a workaround that might result in suboptimal results.
